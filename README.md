# DH150 Assignment 4 - Contextual Inquiry 

## Step 1: Specify Design Challenge 
What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
This activity will assist users buy used clothes online in a safe way given COVID-19 restrictions as well esure quality control and fair pricing. 

What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
It is arguable that buying clothes raging from the most basic of survival needs all the way to self actualization. Clothes are both needed to say warm and be able to feel comfortable and safe, as well as express your identity. Buying used clothes specifically is a good way to support sustainable fashion. 

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are many websites that offer solutions to these issues but many are quite flawed. Websites like Ragstock have a company control the sale of vintage clothes and others like Ebay and Depop allow users to sell clothes to other users. Buying in person might be risky for certain individuals given COVID so finding a safe and sustainable alternative to these websites and actually going in person to thrift stores is key. 

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
They still require environmentally unsustainable shipping and quality control is a big issue when buying from an individual seller on an e-commerce platform like Ebay or Depop. In some cases clothes benign advertised as used or vintage are in fact new. Being able to sort clothes by location would be useful. In addition to this having quality control on the defalf of the website to ensure clothes are used, properly cleaned and fairly priced would be great. 

## Step 2: Identify Target User
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
A user can be literally anyone in this case. All people wear clothes and all should feel a sense of environmental responsibility. Generally speaking vintage clothes is a market dominated by younger men and women from anywhere from 16-30 years old. 

Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users could accomplish this on any of the websites I listed earlier (Depop, Etsy, Ebay) or in person at stores like Goodwill and Savers. 

What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
The actions required to find something that vaguely matches what you are looking for is quite easy, but the steps to find exactly what you are looking for are more difficult. Like I said earlier this can be done either by searching online or in person at a thrift store. 

## Step 3: Choosing a Research Method
Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
I am choosing this method because it allows me to directly find out a target individual's reservations about buying used, as well as learn about lots of their buying tendencies.

## Quotes From Interview
00:04:23
Speaker 2: Generally speaking, I've definitely been online shopping a lot more since the
pandemic than before the pandemic flu.

00:04:40
Speaker 2: No, I would occasionally thrift before the pandemic, but since the pandemic I have
not been.

00:04:54
Speaker 2: I guess it’s because. Of the cleanliness of clothing going to the store in industry,
the pandemic and everything, I'd rather purchase something new.

00:12:11
Speaker 2: Well, honestly, I feel like that I;ll probably shop here again. I wish I got more
information from the seller about like where he or she is located, but. I feel like I expect that
because I’m buying from an independent seller, I’m not buying from a company, so I would have wanted to not had my hand be held as much.

00:16:00
Speaker 2: I mean, on a scale from one to ten, probably for like I only specifically look for
clothing if I need it. I don’t really do it for fun.

## Reflection

I enjoyed the process of having a bit more freedom to see how a user would interact with a site given less specific guidelines. It was more insightful to me to see how someone would actually like to use a site in their own personal life rather than have them complete random objectives. The participant gave me lots of useful information and I think they represented the demographic I was looking for really well (younger female audience). I appreciated their openness to talk about their shopping habits and be honest about their tendencies as a consumer. I was afraid some question would be loaded in to make the participant want to seem like they shopped more vintage clothes than they actually do, but this was not the case. I learned a lot about how the current models of shopping for used clothes in person and online can be improved by drawing the positive aspects from both and making a new online platform. I think having a correct level of regulation and quality control is essential for a site that sells used clothes to be successful.
